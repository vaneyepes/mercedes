    "\n",
    "- Since most y values are around 90–110 seconds (from EDA), RMSE shows roughly a 10% error margin. \n",
    "- R2 shows that the model explains about 40% of the variance in the target variable y\n",

    "**Conclussion:**  Model improved with 10 features. Proceed to regularize in order to improve R2 and RMSE. Lower RMSE shows that Top 10 features model is the best alternative for a baseline. "

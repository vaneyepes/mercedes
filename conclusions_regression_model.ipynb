    "# Basline models vs Ridge Regression with Grid Search\n",
    "## Evaluation Top 3 features  vs Top 10 features\n",
    "\n",
    "We trained  and evaluated 2 multiple regression models using the most correlated features with Y (based on EDA analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation: Linear Regression (Top-3 Features)\n",
    "- RMSE: 9.637 \n",
    "model is off about 9.6 secounds (avg error)\n",
    "- R²:   0.403\n",
    "- Top 3 features: ['X314', 'X261', 'X127'] \n",
    "\n",
    "- Since most y values are around 90–110 seconds (from EDA), RMSE shows roughly a 10% error margin. \n",
    "- R2 shows that the model explains about 40% of the variance in the target variable y\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation: Linear Regression (Top-10 Features)\n",
    "- RMSE: 8.306\n",
    "model is off about 8.3 secounds (avg error)\n",
    "- R²:   0.557\n",
    "-Top 10 features: ['X314', 'X261', 'X127', 'X279', 'X263', 'X232', 'X29', 'X0_az', 'X54', 'X76'] \n",
    "\n",
    "**conclusions Model Top 10**\n",
    "- Improvement of ~1.3 seconds over the top-3 model (RMSE)\n",
    "- The model explains about 56% of the variance in y (R2) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion baseline models:**  Model improved with 10 features. Proceed to regularize in order to improve R2 and RMSE. Lower RMSE shows that Top 10 features model is the best alternative for a baseline. \n",

    "## Evaluation of Ridge regression with grid search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best parameters: {'alpha': 100.0}**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Out of the grid [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100], the best performing alpha was 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "- High alpha = strong regularization - stronger penalty (control overfitting / multicollinearity for a high-dimensional dataset (551 features))\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best CV R²: 0.510**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ridge explained ~51% of the variance on data (good generalization)\n",
    " \n",
    "**Test Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "**MAE: 5.592** On average, predictions are off by about 5.6 seconds (Note: MAE is easier to interpret than RMSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "**RMSE: 8.221** average error, giving more weight to larger mistakes, is 8.2 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "**R²: 0.566** The model explains ~57% of the variance in y\n",
    "\n",
    "- Better than Top-10 Linear Regression (R² = 0.557) and much better than Top-3 Linear (R² = 0.403).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ridge iprove predictive power a little but is preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions Ridge regression \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ridge with all features gave the best performance so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "- RMSE improved to 8.2 vs 9.6 (Top-3) and 8.3 (Top-10)\n",
    "\n",
    "- R² improved to 0.566, explaining more variance than simpler baselines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularization helped the model make use of all features without overfitting"
